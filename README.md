# CSS Grid System

## Understanding the grid system on a deeper level
# History

### **Float**

When the web was 1st created we used Float to align items but floats came with it own problems. When items were aligned often it collapsed.  We have to use extra markup like a clear fix to stop the collapse from happening.

### **Flexbox**

Flexbox help solve this problem but allowing us to align items on a X or Y axis but we still had to nest items if we want to have out child items flex. Also this came with other problems like we were unable to position elements in different views. We had to use some sort of Dom JavaScript to do so. 

### **Grid**

Grid solve a lot of the issues Float and Flex box had. We are now able to position elements on both the X and Y access at the same time. Giving us more flexibility. We are also able to position items in different areas of the page depending on screen size.
